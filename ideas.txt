Sally idea (city planning for women):
- Judge how radial transport is (measure standard deviation of station connectedness?)
- Measure mixed-use areas
- Compare developedness of car infrastructure to public transport (car parks vs stations / bus stops?)
- Number of steps (bad for buggies etc)
- Bike shares inconclusive
- Density of postboxes / benches / playgrounds etc...?
